## Details

This project uses:

-   ES6 (modern Javascript, though I suck at Javascript)
-   [Dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) for layout
-   D3 and [dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3/) for rendering
-   [Graphlib-dot](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib-dot) for parsing
-   [Fuzzyset](https://github.com/Glench/fuzzyset.js) for search

A subset of the genealogy database, `genealogy_graph.json` (the full db you can
find [here](https://github.com/j2kun/math-genealogy-scraper) as `data.json`) is
loaded into the user's browser, a search index is built for name lookups, and
then Gauss's tree is displayed.

The user can then choose a single name to display the ancestry for, or else show
the subset of the graph which contains the closest common ancestor of any two
nodes that are in the same connected component.
